# Little Lemon

Welcome to **Little Lemon**, a web application built using modern technologies. This project demonstrates a well-structured implementation of a React application with REST API integration, styled with Bootstrap, and deployed on GitHub.

## Features

- **React-based Frontend**: Developed using React.js for dynamic and responsive UI.
- **REST API Integration**: Axios is used to fetch and manage data from APIs.
- **User Authentication**: Includes login and registration functionality.
- **User Management**: Displays a list of users retrieved from the API.
- **Bootstrap Styling**: Clean and responsive design using Bootstrap.
- **Deployed on GitHub**: Easily accessible for demonstration purposes.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for API calls.
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for responsive design.
- **REST API**: Backend interaction using endpoints (e.g., Reqres API).
- **GitHub Pages**: For deployment.
